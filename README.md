## Observations

I chose to use VueJS, because it is the framework that I am more familiar with. That said,
I do not have any problem with learning a new one, in fact, I would very much like to!

Since it is a very simple application I did not need to use the Store, I prepared the whole 
application for its future use, that is why Pinia is still installed.

The test were done using Vitest, because it is what Vue developers recommend, it is almost
the same as Jest and could be easily changed if desired to.

Also, the top-bar was designed so it could have more pages in the future, it is always 
good to plan ahead!

There are not many components in the app, because I thought that there was no need to, it
is a very compact and easy to read code.

Vuetify is used because of its very flexible and beautiful components. THe framework its 
very praised and used by the community.
